# 🎨 UI Design Daily - Design to Code

This repository contains a growing collection of HTML & CSS implementations of beautiful UI components originally designed on [UI Design Daily](https://uidesigndaily.com/). Each design is carefully translated into clean code.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder represents a single UI component with:

* `index.html` – The HTML structure.
* `styles.css` – The styling for the component.
* `design.fig` – The original Figma file.

```
/folder/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── design.fig
```

---

## 🚀 Purpose

* Practice converting Figma designs into real code.
* Build a personal UI component library.
* Improve front-end skills with real-world mini projects.
